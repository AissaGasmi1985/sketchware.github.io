An ad unit is one or more Google ads displayed as a result of one piece of the AdSense ad code. You need to generate a Ad Unit to show ads inside your application. This is the breakdown of this guide:

1.  Create an Ad Unit inside your AdMob account.
2.  Add Ad Unit ID inside Sketchware.

## Creating Ad Units

Under your AdMob console, click on `Apps` and click on `Add App`. Follow the guide to add the app.
